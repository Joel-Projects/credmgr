Authenticating with CredentialManager
======================================

CredentialManager supports two types of authentication:

* :ref:`API Token <api_token>`
* :ref:`Username/Password Combo <username_password>`

.. _api_token:

API Token
---------

To create an API Token, you must first `create one here <https://credmgr.jesassn.org/api_tokens/>`_

.. code-block:: python

    from credmgr import CredentialManager

    credentialManager = CredentialManager(username='spaz', password='p@s$w0rd')

.. note:: See here for more ways to pass an API Token to ``credmgr``

.. _username_password:

Username/Password
-----------------

This should be obvious, but this method is utilized by passing username and password to ``credmgr``'s initialization call:

.. code-block:: python

    from credmgr import CredentialManager

    credentialManager = CredentialManager(username='spaz', password='p@s$w0rd')


.. warning:: This method is not recommended and should not be used in prod environments!

To verify that you are authenticated as the correct user run:

.. code-block:: python

       print(credentialManager.currentUser().username)

The output should be your..well uh..username

.. note:: If the following exception is raised, double-check your credentials,
          and ensure that that the API Token or username/password you are using
          are correct and your account is not disabled

          .. code::

                credmgr.exceptions.Unauthorized:
                401: https://credmgr.jesassn.org/api/v1/users/me
                Unauthorized
