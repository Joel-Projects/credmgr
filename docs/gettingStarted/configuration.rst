===============================================

.. toctree::

    configuration/options

Configuration options can be provided to credmgr in one of three ways:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    configuration/credmgrini
    configuration/clientInitialization
    configuration/environmentVariables

Environment variables have the highest priority, followed by keyword arguments to
:class:`.CredentialManager`, and finally settings in ``.credmgr.ini`` files.
